# Language Variability in Neuroscience

This is a repository for submitting manuscript _Unique subfields of neuroscience exhibit more diverse language_.
We analyze language usage of neuroscience abstracts in the largest neuroscience conference, Society for Neuroscience conference.
We found that a field that is more linguistically distant from its nearest fields
tends to use more diverse language. We interpret that they have more breadth of ideas.


The repository contains following folders

- `data` folder contains post-processed SfN dataset
- `code` folder contains code for calculating language variability (see more details in the folder)
- `manuscript` folder contains submission writing for PLOS ONE


## Unique subfields of neuroscience exhibit more diverse language

The fields within neuroscience differ in their heterogeneity and their variability of language usage.
Some fields exhibit more diverse language while others write similarly to their neighboring fields.
However, it is unclear how language diversity and similarity are intertwined.
In this work, we propose that language differentiation of a sub-field promotes its language variability,
a hallmark of exploration. We test this hypothesis using a dataset of recent abstracts from the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) conference.
We find that a field that is more linguistically distant from its nearest field indeed has more within-field variability,
even after controlling for field size and changes over time, suggesting more breadth of ideas.
